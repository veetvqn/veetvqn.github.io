            <p>Hello, and welcome to my portfolio website. Here you can find all sorts of projects I have completed during my college career!</p>

            <h3>Purpose and Goals</h3>
            <p>I am creating this website to showcase a few of the projects I have worked on during my time at Mizzou. The goal of this website is to showcase the skills that I have acquired while studying in Mizzou's Computer Science courses. I had a lot of fun creating these projects, so I hope you will find them interesting.</p>
            
            <p>One of the end goals for me is to have this website serve as a kind of hub where I can store information on all of my projects so I can share it with recruiters as a way of getting their attention and displaying my unique skills. As a bonus, it would be cool to have this place where I can look back on my projects myself and maybe share them with others as well.</p>
