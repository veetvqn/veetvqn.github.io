            <h3>Who I Am</h3>
            <p>Hello, My name is Viet Nguyen, and I am a Computer Science student at the University of Missouri. 
                My parents immigrated to the United States from Vietnam, and I was born and raised in Kansas City. 
                After graduating high school, I was kind of struggling to find what I wanted to do for my college career,
                so I entered under undecided engineering. After taking a few computer science coursees, I found that this was
                something that I enjoyed, so I decided to major in Computer Science. Since then, I have achieved a minor in mathematics
                and a minor in Information Technology. I am currently in my senior year, and I am looking forward to graduating in the spring of 2026.
            </p>

            <h3>Education Overview</h3>
            <p>Again, I am a Computer Science major here at the University of Mizzouri. The specific field I am most focused in would be 
                any job that would be willing to hire me in the current computer science economy. I am in my senior year at the moment, and 
                I'm actually planning on graduating at the end of this semester. Other than graduating high school, and soon to graduate college, 
                I havent achieved any other big academic milestones.
